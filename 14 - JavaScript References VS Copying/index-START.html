    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // placing nothing into slice will make a copy of the actual array

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // concatenating players into an empty array

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // take out each item in your iritable and place them into the containing array
    // you can also spread into a function
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Andrew',
        age: 30
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // start with a blank obj, pass it the obj you wish to copy, new properties that you wish to overwrite
    // if the properties are the same then it overwrites the property
    const cap = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Joe'});
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully SOON SEE THE OBJECT ...SPREAD!!!!!!!!!!!*************
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const drew = {
        name: 'Drew',
        age: 200,
        social: {
            twitter: 'Hell na',
            facebook: 'every now and again'
        }
    }
    console.log(drew);
    // to clone every level of an Object you need a function called cloneDeep very rarely do you need to clone an object that deep
    const dev = Object.assign({}, drew); //makes an exact copy ONLY ONE LEVEL DEEP

    // kind of hacky way of doing it
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(drew)); // stringify makes it a string and then you're immediately parsing it to turn it back into an object
